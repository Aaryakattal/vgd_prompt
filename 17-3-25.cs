Test youre knowledge code answer 

string projectName = "ACME";
string englishLocation = $@"c:\Exercise\{projectName}\data.txt";
Console.WriteLine($"View English output:\n\t\t{englishLocation}\n");

string russianMessage = "\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0432\u043e\u0434";
string russianLocation = $@"c:\Exercise\{projectName}\ru-RU\data.txt";
Console.WriteLine($"{russianMessage}:\n\t\t{russianLocation}\n");

This was very confusing, It was confusing in the parts that used string interpolation and i found that finding the correct spaces to put the Strings, I think diviam had the same problem.
